Yizhar's work, including his novels, poetry, and essays, were rich in lyrical language and explored themes of identity, memory, and the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His return to writing after a 30-year hiatus with the novel \"Mikdamot\" (1992) was met with critical acclaim and marked a significant return to his earlier work. Yizhar was also an intelligence officer during the War of Independence and served in the Knesset, highlighting his involvement in Israeli politics. His work was influential in shaping the literary landscape of post-war Israel and his legacy continues to be studied and discussed by scholars and readers alike.", "scores": {"BFI": {"raw_answers": [2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5], "dimension_scores": {"Extraversion": {"sum": 27, "average": 3.375}, "Agreeableness": {"sum": 32, "average": 3.5555555555555554}, "Conscientiousness": {"sum": 32, "average": 3.5555555555555554}, "Neuroticism": {"sum": 23, "average": 2.875}, "Openness": {"sum": 40, "average": 4.0}}}, "PANAS": {"raw_answers": [4, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 5, 2, 5, 3], "dimension_scores": {"Positive": {"sum": 43, "average": 4.3}, "Negative": {"sum": 23, "average": 2.3}}}, "BPAQ": {"raw_answers": [2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2], "dimension_scores": {"Physical": {"sum": 23, "average": 2.5555555555555554}, "Verbal": {"sum": 16, "average": 3.2}, "Anger": {"sum": 17, "average": 2.4285714285714284}, "Hostility": {"sum": 28, "average": 3.5}}}, "SSCS": {"raw_answers": [4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], "dimension_scores": {"Personal Identity": {"sum": 22, "average": 4.4}, "Self-efficacy": {"sum": 24, "average": 4.0}}}}}
