Project repository for LLM psychoanalysis

# How to run
To run `main.py`, which is responsible for prompting the LLM, it is necessary to have the model running in the LM Studio application. Once the model is active, you can begin the prompting process by executing the following command in the console:

```bash
python main.py --results-dir model_name --loglevel log_level --end n_personas --batch_size batch_size
